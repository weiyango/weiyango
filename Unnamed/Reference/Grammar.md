## Grammar

### Intro

We'll explore grammar sentence by sentence adding complexity as we go.
The grammar at its simplest is SVO.

We can not avoid complex sentence, as it's needed for high level thoughts.
However, we can try to make it painless and natural.

The following sections will be using the words specified in the Lexicon.

### Grammar Terms

Our Language has at its basic form, Noun and Verb.
Then we have Adjective and Adverbs to modify them.
We will explore the word order through usage and examples.

### Decisions

No inflections.
No case for nouns.
No tense for verbs. Use temporal adverbs.
No aspect (ongoing vs completed) for verbs.

Head Order. I originally chose SVO and Head-initial, but it's not clear.
I'll use MOSTLY Japanese grammar and Head-final instead.
You have to define Headness for each grammatical phrase.
That would work since the problem with abolising Kanji
is the number of homynyms. Not the grammar. This just might work.

### Examples

boku love kimi - I love you
tabelu - Eat
tabelu banana - Eat banana
genuki. boku tabelu - Fine. I eat

I have demonstrated SVO, V, VO, SV, and A.

oisi banana - Tasty banana
veri suki banana - Very I-like banana.
