### Syllabic Structure

As specified in the Phonetics section.
Each syllable will have either

- one character, vowel without C1 or C2. eg. a, i, u, e, o
- two characters, vowel with C1 eg. ba, pi, mu, or vowel with C2. eg. an, im, ul
- three character, vowel with C1 and C2. eg. ban, pim, mul

You can combine the syllables to form words.
Eg. combine "a", "pi", and "mul" to form "apimul".

You might ask if it might be possible to write "ap", "im", and "ul" and I wouldn't know the difference.
It is true both in writing and fast speech. You could always insert spaces, use apostrophe mark
or capital letters but those are discouraged.
However, due to the rules of Phonetics, a C2 is forbidden if a C3 starts with a blank, to avoid this situation.

So you could always be sure the consonant belongs to the next syllable.

Theoretically. you do not need spaces in this language.
However, I recommend spaces between words.
