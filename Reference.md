WEIYANOKO (Wai Yan Language)

A natural language designed to be easy and practical. Takes the best of other languages such as English&#39;s alphabet writing system and consonants, Japanese&#39;s vowels, pronunciation system and vocabulary, and Chinese&#39;s simple grammar.

**Phonetics** : 22 English Consonants. 5 Japanese Vowels.

- Blank as in &quot;Oh&quot;
- K as in &quot;King&quot;
- G as in &quot;Gift&quot;
- S as in &quot;Sun&quot;
- SH as in &quot;She&quot;
- Z as in &quot;Zoo&quot;
- T as in &quot;Tea&quot;
- D as in &quot;Did&quot;
- TS as in Japanese Tsu
- CH as in &quot;Chair&quot;
- J as in &quot;Jack&quot;
- N as in &quot;No&quot;
- H as in &quot;Help&quot;
- P as in &quot;Papa&quot;
- F as in &quot;Food&quot;
- V as in &quot;Victory&quot;
- B as in &quot;Be&quot;
- M as in &quot;Mama&quot;
- Y as in &quot;You&quot;
- L as in &quot;Look&quot;
- R as in &quot;Right&quot;
- W as in &quot;Winner&quot;

Notes: T, P, M has no difference in aspiration aka &quot;soft&quot;. TS was added to be a superset of basic Hiragana in Japanese, so that WeiYano can absorb most of Japanese vocab. Japanese &quot;R&quot; can be approximated into English/WeiYano &quot;R&quot;. There are more consonants in hope that we can reduce homophones.

There are five vowels, same as in Japanese. &quot;A&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;O&quot;. We will inherit most of Japanese pronunciation system, including but not limited to &quot;suki&quot; -\&gt; &quot;ski&quot; vowel dropping, &quot;desu&quot; to &quot;des&quot; ending and more. We will not have germinations like &quot;chotto&quot; or the &quot;N&quot; kana. &quot;chotto&quot; could be approximated to &quot;chouto&quot;.

Therefore, the system is based on mora. Each mora will have exactly one or zero consonant and one vowel. &quot;va&quot; uses &quot;V&quot; consonant and &quot;A&quot; vowel. Consonant clusters make pronunciation much harder and therefore slower to use. Meaning, we will not inherit those from Japanese.

**Writing System** : English alphabet as described in Phonetics section. Letter-case prefers lowercase. SH, TS, and CH, can be alternatively written as X, C, Q, respectively, if you need one letter, but consider otherwise as this will be mispronounced without prior knowledge.

**Lexicon** : All Japanese words as long as they can be approximated into WeiYano. Those that can&#39;t can make do with very bad approximations. Out-Japanese the Japanese in taking vocabulary. More on Grammar.

**Grammar** : Chinese grammar. I&#39;ll give you a word &quot;KU&quot; for all purpose general counter / classifier / numerator that is always appropriate. Chinese has &quot;GE&quot; but we can&#39;t use it. The whole point of this with Japanese phonetics is to not have to deal with Chinese sounds, so we will not be stealing ANY Chinese words. I haven&#39;t yet studied much of Chinese, but I know it has dead simple grammar. So, replace the Chinese particles with closest meaning Japanese particle that you can find.

**Why another language?** It&#39;s to avoid hard Chinese sounds and writing system. It&#39;s to avoid hard Japanese grammar. It&#39;s to get the good qualities of Japanese such as simple pronunciation system. It&#39;s to get the good qualities of the English alphabet as it is easy to read, write, input. It fixes English&#39;s and Kanji&#39;s &quot;How do I pronounce this?&quot; with a phonetic first system where you if you can read it, you can pronounce it, then you can understand it. So, easy writing system, easy pronunciation, easy grammar. You can already read, write, and speak it. The vocabulary&#39;s already there with almost the entirety of Japanese. The grammar is the intuitively simple standard modern Mandarin. If you can express it in Mandarin, swap in the Japanese words, you can already use the language. The only possible improvements are in optimizing the selected consonants.

**Advantages** :

Again, I&#39;ll repeat again. **DEAD SIMPLE WRITING SYSTEM**. No weird pinyin like marks here and there. And everybody already knows how to write it. **DEAD SIMPLE PHONETICS**. Just 5 vowels and consonants easy for all speakers to learn with little practice. No gotchas. **DEAD SIMPLE GRAMMAR**. Mandarin. It&#39;s a fully fleshed out easy straightforward language grammar. **THE VOCAB IS ALREADY THERE**. A huge percentage of the Japanese vocabulary at your service, with many more when approximated. **THERE ARE ALREADY SPEAKERS**. Those that know Chinese and Japanese can already speak the language. **LEARN ONE LANGUAGE, GET TWO FREE**. Shared vocabulary with Japanese, same grammar with Mandarin. I won&#39;t even mention the English alphabet.

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

**But isn&#39;t it biased?** Yes, so? It&#39;s biased to be easy. Find a better contender in any single way before making further criticisms.

**Closing Notes**

Any suggestions or improvements or welcome as this is still in &quot;beta&quot; so to speak. I&#39;m still trying to find faults in the system and will improve too. Basic formula is English alphabet, Chinese grammar, Japanese phonetics. I&#39;ve modified the phonetics part myself so it is the likeliest to have faults that need fixing.
